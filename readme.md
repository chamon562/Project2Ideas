### ERD

----------------------------------------------------------
### User Stories
Who => : Monster hunter is a big game that has so many things to do, but just like the title, what makes this game so great is hunting these amazingly dangerous monsters. Furthermore, if the player has successfully hunted the monster, an rng system is put in play for the drop rewards/items, and the player will need these items to be able to craft their armor and weapons. However, the catch is that the monster will not carry all the things they need to craft what the player wants. That will come from hunting multiple monsters, to come back full circle and create their weapon/gear. 

What => : The app is to help MH players see weapons, and Armor attributes as well as see the monsters they need to defeat in order to get the items needed to craft what they want. 

Why : This app can provide guindance for players, and give a faster way to access information they need for their items. For example, the Monster weakness and its items drops. Once the player clicks on the Monster it will show what the monster drops, and can make their judgement wether this Monster is worth their time. This helpful information can also be used to see the different attributes of Armor and its stats, and the same can go for the weapons. Also pictures always adds the cool factor how the armor looks along with the Monster they would have to face. Happy hunting they would say.
